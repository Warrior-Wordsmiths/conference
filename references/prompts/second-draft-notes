> that was great but i have some notes:\
  1. I dont like the blue. switch to the black, white, and yellow like colors you currently have. \
  2. I moved some action cards into the hero section of the home page, those specific ones should be scaled to be smaller so  
  the hero section is ultimately the size of @assets\mfb_poster.png \
  3. I think the registration page can be styled like colums under the fee price. this way people can read what their
  registration includes along with their payment options\
  4. to the right of the The Central Valley Conference... paragraph in the home page place
  @assets\faculty_development_center.png\
  5. place the @assets\BWWS_logo.png on the contact page nicely\\
  6. include @assets\friday-13.jpg on the registration info
