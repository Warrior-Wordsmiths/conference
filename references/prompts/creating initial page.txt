 your objective is to use the @references\STYLE-GUIDE-REFERENCE.md to create the html code for my webpage about a
  conference named Media in full bloom. You will gain all the information you need about this project in
  @references\2025CFP_Draft.md .  Here are general notes I want you to consider when creating this website:\
  Title: Welcome to the 2026 Media in Full Bloom conference information and registration page!

  Begin by placing the @assets\mfb_poster.png in the left side of the page. to the right you should start writing text. keep  
  in mind this text will wrap on the webpage. the text you will write will be text you directly copy or slightly tweak from   
  @references\2025CFP_Draft.md . The information will be in the following order:
  General Information (date, time, place, keynote address, feature film, journal, campus, area, hotels and other
  accommodations)

  Registration information (Cost, description of what you get for the $35.00, where to send money, link for credit card       
  payment)\

  Deadline for submissions will be January 2026, so that info will change

  There will be a conference registration fee of $35. That includes lunch, refreshments, a conference badge, keynote
  speaker, access to a screening of Friday the 13th and the opportunity for participants to submit their conference essay to
