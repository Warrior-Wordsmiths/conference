Below are general improvements I would like you to make to the design of @index.html
1. In <div class="hero-content
<h2>Welcome to the 2026 Media in Full Bloom Conference Information and Registration Page!</h2>
replace this header with the same text and formatting you used for <h1>.wp-block-site-tile, and then delete the header on the webpage. basically, delete the welcome message and replace it with the header.
2. The hero content text should be center alligned so the formatting looks more symmetrical with the title and poster.
3. Each header in the main content of the page should be centered.
4. Registration Information Should be moved to a different page that will be on our navigatable header you implement in step five.
5. Implement a navigatable header with a home page, registration information, and contact page. 
5a. preferabbly, keep this within one html file. if not possible, create and link to other html files.
5b. Questions section onwards stays on the homepage
6.Footer should be #11181f all the way across the screen, but it is only in the center and trapped in margins
