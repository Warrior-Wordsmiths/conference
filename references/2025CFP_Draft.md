Finished papers should have a presentation time of 15-18 minutes. We encourage submissions from first-time, undergraduate conference participants as well as seasoned graduate students. The atmosphere is collegial and welcoming; we at Stanislaus State welcome a diversity of opinion, adventurous thinking, and a free and open exchange of ideas. The deadline for submissions is December 15th, 2025\. To chair a special session, please submit the session title, a brief description and justification for the session, and 3-4 abstracts (including individual paper titles and CVs) from session participants.

The conference will be held on the campus of Stanislaus State University on Friday, March 13th. The beautiful 228-acre space is situated in the heart of California’s great Central Valley—a short distance from the San Francisco Bay Area, Monterey, and Sacramento. Conference fees will include lunch and a keynote address. Participants may choose to stay late for a special film screening and discussion, with appropriately selected fare to munch as you watch.
